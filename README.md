# Emergency Department Wait Time Analysis  

## Overview  
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of patient wait times in the Emergency Department (ED). By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, the project identifies key factors affecting wait times and proposes actionable recommendations to improve operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.  

## Data Description  
The dataset used in this project includes anonymized patient records, time logs, and operational metrics from the Emergency Department. Key attributes include:  
- **Patient ID**: Unique identifier for patients.  
- **Arrival Time**: Time when the patient arrived at the ED.  
- **Triage Category**: Severity of the condition.  
- **Treatment Start Time**: Time when treatment started.  
- **Discharge Time**: Time when the patient was discharged.  

## Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Visualizations of wait times and patient flow.  
  - Identification of peak hours and bottlenecks.  
- **Statistical Analysis**:  
  - Analysis of correlations between triage categories, arrival times, and wait times.  
- **Predictive Modeling** *(if applicable)*:  
  - Predicting wait times based on patient and operational data.  
- **Recommendations**:  
  - Suggested strategies to reduce wait times and improve efficiency.
